Beginner's Repository

Hello, world! I'm a student who's currently got about a year of C++ experience under my belt.
I'm using GitHub in order to get more experience with coding in general. If you see any code
that is either incorrect or can be rewritten more efficiently, please feel free to give me
your suggestions - after all, I'm here to learn!
